# Page transitions with Bender

Bender is a package that empowers your application with page transitions.

![bender](http://madeira.hccanet.org/project2/michels_p2/website%20pics/bender.jpg)

# Dependencies

* Meteor 1.0

# Getting Started

To install Bender add it to meteor

```
meteor add gabrielpoca:bender
```

To use Bender you need to initialize it with the page container as an argument.

```
Template.layout.rendered = ->
  Bender.initialize(@find('#content-container'))
```

## Animating elements

By default Bender will have no animation after being initialized. You can change
this by calling the `animate` function.

```
Bender.animate('slideRight')
```

It is also possible to use the
[`Iron.Router`](http://eventedmind.github.io/iron-router/), but instead of
`Router.go` use `Bender.go` and pass in the animation as an option. Everything
else should work as expected with the `Iron.Router`.

```
Bender.go('trips.show', { _id: @id }, { animation: 'slideDown' })
```

### List of available animations

|Name      |Description|
|----------|-----------------------------|
|slideDown |Slides the current page down |
|slideUp   |Slides the current page up   |
|slideLeft |Slides the current page left |
|slideRight|Slides the current page right|
|none      |Removes animations           |

# Roadmap

[ ] More transition animations
[ ] Make bender more configurable (animation duration, easing, etc...)
